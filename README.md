# Hand Pose Classification Experiments

Machine learning experiments to train different models to classify hand poses. The training datasets are based on the [mediapipe solution](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html) along with the [Handy Interaction App](https://github.com/AntonioEscamilla/HandyInteraction) to record the instances for training.

## Training Set
To build a good classifier appropriate pose instances should be collected for training (e.g., “open_hand” and “close_hand”). It’s important that different instances in the dataset cover different camera angles, camera proximity, hand shapes, and pose variations.
