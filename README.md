# Hand Pose Classification Experiments

Machine learning experiments to train different models to classify hand poses. The training datasets are based on the [mediapipe solution] (https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html) along with the [Handy Interaction App] (https://github.com/AntonioEscamilla/HandyInteraction) to record the instances for training.
